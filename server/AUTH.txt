EXPRESS JS
It is used for designing and building web applications 
quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps 
that you can run on a web browser. 
Since Express. js only requires javascript, 
it becomes easier for programmers and developers 
to build web applications and API without any effort.
----------------------------------------------------
ROUTER IN EXPRESS
js server. The express. Router() function is used to
 create a new router object. This function is used when you
 want to create a new router object in your program 
 to handle requests.
 Routing refers to determining how an application
 responds to a client request to a particular endpoint,
 which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
  Each route can have one or more handler functions, 
 which are executed when the route is matched.
 ---------------------------------------------------
 JWT
 JWTs are mainly used for authentication. After a user signs in 
 to an application, the application then assigns JWT 
 to that user. Subsequent requests by the user will 
 include the assigned JWT. 
 This token tells the server what routes, services, 
 and resources the user is allowed to access.
 ---------------------------------------------------
 ROUTER.POST()
 router. post() refers to POST requests and router. get() 
 refers to GET request. The difference between the two is
  that a GET request, is requesting data from a specified
  source and a POST request submits data to a specified 
  resource to be processed.
  --------------------------------------------------
  RES.JSON
  The res. json() function sends a JSON response. 
  This method sends a response (with the correct content-type) 
  that is the parameter converted to a JSON string using 
  the JSON. stringify() method.
  res. json() in react means: when you try fetch data
  from a server, it will send you a RESPONSE which contains 
  tons of irrelevant information.
   To target only the BODY part of the response and 
   to convert it from JSON to javascript, you use res. json()
  --------------------------------------------------
  AWAIT
  await is usually used to unwrap promises by 
  passing a Promise as the expression . 
  Using await pauses the execution of its
  surrounding async function until the promise 
  is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected).
  When execution resumes, the value of the await 
  expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.
   -------------------------------------------------
   GEN-SALT
   genSalt() method. This method accepts an 
   integer value which is the cost factor 
   that determines the time taken to hash a
   password.
